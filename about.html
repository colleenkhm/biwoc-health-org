                    <p>
                      Hi! I'm Eada Talal Al-Soodani and I'm a mixed Arab from Saudi
                      Arabia and white from the United States. I moved from Saudi to
                      the US when I was ten with my 4 siblings. I identify as a Female
                      and go by she/her pronouns.
                      <br></br>I lived in a small town in Washington State and moved
                      to Eugene, Oregon to get my Bachelor's degrees in Political
                      Science at University of Oregon. I currently work at a Dispute
                      Resolution Center as a Program Coordinator.
                      <br></br>I started BIWOC health with my friend Sarah LaPlante
                      because of my negative experience in healthcare. Like myself,
                      many Black, Indigenous, and People of Color - Women have
                      struggled with physical and mental health issues without getting
                      the proper care they deserve and need.
                      <br></br>
                      My hope is to have our voices heard about the struggles we have
                      gone through. I hope we can increase the amount of women in
                      healthcare. I hope we can have justice for women's reproductive
                      rights. I hope we can live in a country where we donâ€™t have to
                      worry about our medical bill.
                      <br></br>
